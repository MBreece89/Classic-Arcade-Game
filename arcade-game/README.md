Documentation

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
README

A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

Comments

Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.

Code Quality

Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
